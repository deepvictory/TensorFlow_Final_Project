Synopsis of project

Many patients after getting treatment in a hospital ends up readmitted within 30 days. This might be caused by many reasons such as past treatment, demographic reasons, past medical conditions etc… A readmission within a short timespan due to similar condition causes health and financial losses to patient and reflects poor quality of care by healthcare provider.

I am planning to build a machine learning model which can detect if a diabetic patient is prone to getting readmitted within 30 days of care encounter. This model’s prediction can be used by healthcare provider to intervene and plan care.
